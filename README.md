# Readme

This repo holds some of my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. They are arranged with year and may hold one or both solution parts to the challenges.

To run go solutions, simply run ```go run <part-one.go>``` or whichever name it has.

This is not meant to be perfect solutions and are merely hobby solutions that I work on when I am bored :)
